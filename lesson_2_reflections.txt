What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	This text editor, Sublime, kills me. It does not ask to save, nor saves
	things automatically. Anyways, Git creates a folder named .git, which
	will contain metadata, data about file changes. Then I will have a place
	to commit, my changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area is the place where Git tracks differences. Working directory is
	the directory that we use for our project. Repository is a container for
	changes that we have done so far.
