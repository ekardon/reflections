When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When I work on a project with a team. Or, where I need some contributers. Opening
	respiratory to public (because of ridicilous GitHub shit) users would test it, and
	I can get feedback from them. Solving problems and so. When in private, it is to 
	share with my other devices, and a safe place to keep them.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	There might be some changes in local version of the repository, so I guess, I would
	not want Git to screw it. Plus, there might not be always something to pull. It is
	good practive to do it manually.
