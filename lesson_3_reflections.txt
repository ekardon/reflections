When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When I work on a project with a team. Or, where I need some contributers. Opening
	respiratory to public (because of ridicilous GitHub shit) users would test it, and
	I can get feedback from them. Solving problems and so. When in private, it is to 
	share with my other devices, and a safe place to keep them.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	There might be some changes in local version of the repository, so I guess, I would
	not want Git to screw it. Plus, there might not be always something to pull. It is
	good practive to do it manually.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?

	Fork, clone, and branch. Fork and clone is similar but branch is ridiculously diff
	from other two. I would use branch when I want to do some experiment with my code
	in my local machine. When I want to copy someone else's code and work on it, on my
	GitHub, I use fork. Finally, when I want to copy my codes from GitHub, or from some
	other device, I use clone.
